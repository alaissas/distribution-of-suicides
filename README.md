**Machine Learning Approaches to Understand Suicide Causes and Patterns in India**

---

**Project Overview**
This project explores the causes and trends of suicides in India using machine learning and statistical methods. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, it identifies patterns and correlations in suicide data across states, genders, and causes, offering insights for better preventive actions. Additionally, the project implements machine learning models to analyze trends and predict future occurrences based on historical data.
